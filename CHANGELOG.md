Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development.
Anything may change at any time.
The public API should not be considered stable.
